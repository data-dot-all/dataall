## Pre-requisites <a name="pre-reqs"></a>
You need to have the tools below up and running to proceed with the deployment:

* python 3.8 or higher
* virtualenv `pip install virtualenv`
* node
* npm
* aws-cdk: installed globally `npm install -g aws-cdk`
* aws-cdk credentials plugin: installed globally `npm install -g cdk-assume-role-credential-plugin`
* aws-cli (v2)
* git client

Run the below command to verify that you have git cli installed. It should list your `user.name` and `user.email` at a minimum.
```bash
git config --list
```


In addition, you will need at least two AWS accounts. For each of these accounts you will need **AWS Administrator credentials** 
ready to use on your terminal. Do not proceed if you are not administrator in the tooling
account, and in the deployment account(s).

- **Tooling account**: hosts the code repository, and the CI/CD pipeline. We can use any region to deploy the CI/CD resources
if the underlying AWS services (CodeCommit, CodeBuild...) are available in the selected region. In addition, you will need
access to a second region. The reason is that we use [CDK Pipelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.pipelines-readme.html), 
an opinionated CDK construct that deploys a cross-region replication support stack. For all regions except `us-east-1` the replication region is `us-east-1`.
- **Deployment account(s)**: hosts data.all's backend and frontend AWS infrastructure. You can deploy 
data.all to multiple environments on the same or multiple AWS accounts (e.g dev, test, qa, prod). If deployment is configured
with `internet_facing` set to true, `us-east-1` is required for the deployment of some frontend components. 
Backend resources can be hosted in any region given that the AWS services used are available.

**Important**: the selected region for the tooling account and for the backend resources (deployment account) MUST be 
the same one.

If you are not deploying data.all in production mode, you could use the same AWS account as the Tooling 
and the Deployment account.

Make sure that the AWS services used in data.all are available in the Regions you choose for tooling and deployment. 
Check out the [Architecture](../architecture/). Moreover, data.all uses [CDK Pipelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.pipelines-readme.html) in the Tooling account,
which means that AWS services used by this construct need to be available in the tooling account (e.g. CodeArtifact).
## 1. Clone data.all code <a name="clone"></a>

Clone the GitHub repository from:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/data-dot-all/dataall.git --branch v2.6.1
cd dataall
```
## 2. Setup Python virtualenv <a name="env"></a>
From your personal computer or from Cloud9 in the AWS Console, create a python virtual environment 
from the code using python 3.8, then install the necessary deploy requirements with the following commands:

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ./deploy/requirements.txt
pip install git-remote-codecommit
```
## 3. Mirror the code to a CodeCommit or CodeStar Connections repository <a name="code"></a>
### Using CodeCommit:
Assuming AWS tooling account Administrator credentials, create an AWS CodeCommit repository, mirror the data.all code 
and push your changes:
Run the following to check your credentials:
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
```bash
aws codecommit create-repository --repository-name dataall
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin codecommit::<aws-region>://dataall
git init
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git push --set-upstream origin main
```
### Using CodeStar Connection to GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab or Bitbucket:
If you choose to use a GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket repository, it's important to note that you need to set up an AWS CodeStar connection to your repository for seamless integration. 
This connection allows AWS CodePipeline to interact securely with GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab or Bitbucket. 
Before mirroring the data.all code and pushing any changes, make sure to set up the CodeStar connection by following 
the steps detailed in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/connections-create.html):
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Developer tools > Settings > Connections.
3. Choose the option to "Create a connection" and select the source provider.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate and authorize AWS to access the selected source.
5. Once the connection is established, copy the provided connection ARN. We will use it in step 6 as value for the `repo_connection_arn` parameter of the `cdk.json` file. 

Make sure that you have the necessary permissions and authentication set up for the repository. 
To mirror the data.all code and push your changes, follow the standard Git commands:
```bash
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin <GitHub-repository-URL>
git init
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git push --set-upstream origin main
```
## 4. Bootstrap tooling account <a name="boot"></a>
The **Tooling** account is where the code repository, and the CI/CD pipeline are deployed.
It needs to be bootstrapped with CDK in 2 regions, your selected region and us-east-1.

The **Deployment** account(s) is where the data.all application infrastructure will be deployed.
Each of the deployment account(s) needs to be bootstrapped with CDK in 2 regions, your selected region and us-east-1.

Remember that the selected region for the tooling account and for the backend resources (deployment account) MUST be 
the same one.

Run the commands below with the AWS credentials of the tooling account:

Your region (can be any supported region)
```bash
cdk bootstrap aws://<tooling-account-id>/<aws-region>
```
North Virginia region (needed to be able to deploy cross region to us-east-1)
```bash
cdk bootstrap aws://<tooling-account-id>/us-east-1
```
## 5. Bootstrap deployment account(s) <a name="boot2"></a>

Run the commands below with the AWS credentials of the deployment account:

Your region (can be any supported region)
```bash
cdk bootstrap --trust <tooling-account-id> --trust-for-lookup <tooling-account-id> -c @aws-cdk/core:newStyleStackSynthesis=true --cloudformation-execution-policies arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess aws://<deployment-account-id>/<aws-region>
```

If you plan to configure the deployment with internet-facing frontend, you also need to bootstrap the North Virginia region (needed for Cloudfront integration with ACM on us-east-1)
```bash
cdk bootstrap --trust <tooling-account-id> --trust-for-lookup <tooling-account-id> -c @aws-cdk/core:newStyleStackSynthesis=true --cloudformation-execution-policies arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess aws://<deployment-account-id>/us-east-1
```
## 6. Configure the deployment options in the cdk.json file <a name="cdkjson"></a>
We use a parameters cdk.json file to configure and customize your deployment of data.all. This file is at the root level
of our repository. Open it, you should be seen something like:
```json

All the configurations are required if setting data.all with an external OIDC supported IDP |

**Example 1**: Basic deployment: this is an example of a minimum configured cdk.json file.

```json
{
  "app": "python ./deploy/app.py",
  "context": {
    "@aws-cdk/aws-apigateway:usagePlanKeyOrderInsensitiveId": false,
    "@aws-cdk/aws-cloudfront:defaultSecurityPolicyTLSv1.2_2021": true,

            "region": "eu-west-1"
        }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Example 2**: Customized deployment: here we are customizing the cdk.json with all 
parameters using their non-default values in at least one of the 
deployments. By specifying multiple environment blocks, "dev" and "prod", data.all will
deploy to 2 deployments accounts.

}
```

### 6.1 (Important) - Configure data.all to use external Idp
Out of the box, data.all uses Cognito as the Idp and the user pool provider. If you have your own IDP, you can use Cognito as a proxy 
and connect your IDP with Cognito using SAML. With this combination, data.all authentication essentially occurs with your external IDP. 
Please note, the user pools is still managed by Cognito User Pool. 

If you have own IDP and also manage your own user pool, you can configure data.all to directly use your IDP. Please read this section only if you want deploying data.all with an external IDP.

Data.all can also be configured to use an external Idp
which supports OIDC. In order to do so, please add `custom_auth` section into your `cdk.json` file as shown in **Example-3**. 

This will take care of configuring data.all frontend to use the external IDP URL at the time of login. Also, it will setup a 
custom authorizer lambda and attach it to the API gateway. This custom authorizer lambda will work in place of the cognito authorizer,
which is deployed by default. 

**Important** - 
When setting up data.all, the user pool is managed by Cognito. Here you can make teams and group users in a team. This forms the data.all team.
When using custom authentication, this information will have to be maintained by either your IDP or any other systems you use to maintain
group information. 

When using custom authentication, you will have to create a file and implement 3 functions from `dataall/base/services/ServiceProvider.py`
For example, you can create a package like `dataall/base/custom_auth/MyProvider.py` and create your own class and implement the methods as shown below
```python
class MyProvider(ServiceProvider):
    def get_user_emailids_from_group(self, group_name):
        # Your implementation
    
    def get_groups_for_user(self, user_id):
        # Your implementation
    
    def list_groups(self, envname: str, region: str):
        # Your implementation
```

Once you implement these methods, return an instance of your provider in `dataall/base/service/ServiceProviderFactory.py` . Please follow the 
instructions in the comments to create and return an instance of your custom service provider. Here's an example of an implementation for your reference, 
```python
    def get_service_provider_instance():
        if (os.environ.get("custom_auth", None)):
            # Return instance of your service provider which implements the ServiceProvider interface
            # Please take a look at the "Deploy to AWS" , External IDP section for steps
            try:
                # Instantiate your instance of custom Service Provider
                return MyProvider()
            except Exception as e:
                print(e)
        else:
            return Cognito()
```
## 7. Configure the application modules in the config.json file <a name="configjson"></a>
In data.all V2 you can enable, disable, configure and add new modules to your data.all deployment in the `config.json` file
located at the top level of the repository. Here is an example file, where you
can distinguish 2 parts: `modules` and `core`. Read the following subsections to understand each of these parts and 
the different configuration options. 

```json
{
    "modules": {
        "mlstudio": {
            "active": true
        },
        "notebooks": {
            "active": true
        },
        "datapipelines": {
            "active": true
        },
        "omics": {
            "active": false
        },
        "datasets_base": {
            "active": true,
            "features": {
              "share_notifications": {
                "email": {
                  "active": false,
                  "persistent_reminders": false,
                  "parameters": {
                    "group_notifications": true
                  }
                }
              },
              "confidentiality_dropdown" : true,
              "topics_dropdown" : true,
              "auto_approval_for_confidentiality_level" : {
                "Unclassified" : true,
                "Official" : true,
                "Secret" : true
              }
            }
          },
        "s3_datasets": {
            "active": true,
            "features": {
              "file_uploads": true,
              "file_actions": true,
              "aws_actions": true,
              "preview_data": true,
              "glue_crawler": true
            }
          },
        "s3_datasets_shares": {
            "active": true
          },
        "worksheets": {
            "active": true
        },
        "dashboards": {
            "active": true
        },
        "maintenance": {
            "active": true
        }
    },
    "core": {
        "features": {
            "env_aws_actions": true,
            "cdk_pivot_role_multiple_environments_same_account": false,
            "enable_quicksight_monitoring": false
        }
    }
}
```

### Enable/disable modules
The first thing that you'll need to do is to set a certain module to `"active": true` to enable the module or `"active": false` to disable it. 
If a module is disabled, the module related APIs and frontend views won't be created.

If a module depends on other modules we do not need to explicitly define it as active in the `config.json`. For example,
`datasets` depend on the `dataset-sharing` module. `dataset-sharing` will be loaded even if we do not declare it in the
`config.json`.

The following table contains a list of the available modules and their dependencies with a very brief explanation of the
functionality. If you want to know more about each module, 
check the [UserGuide](https://github.com/data-dot-all/dataall/blob/main/UserGuide.pdf) available as PDF in the repository.

### Disable module features
As you probably noticed, the `s3_datasets` module contains an additional field called `features` in the `config.json`. 
If there is a particular functionality that you want to enable or disable you can do so in this section. 
In the example config.json, the feature that enables file upload from data.all UI has been disabled.

```json
    "s3_datasets": {
        "active": true,
        "features": {
            "file_uploads": false,
        }

### Customizing Module Features

In addition to disabling / enabling, some module features allow for additional customization to create a tailored data.all for your needs. Below is one such example of how one could customize module features in the config.json. Please refer to the list for all customization options
```json
    "s3_datasets": {
        "features": {
            "..."
            "custom_confidentiality_mapping": {
                 "Public" : "Unclassified",
                 "Private" : "Official", 
                 "Confidential" : "Secret",
                 "Very Highly Confidential" : "Secret"
            },
            "..."
        }
    }
```

| **Customization**                  | **Module** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| custom_confidentiality_mapping | s3_datasets          | Provides custom confidentiality mapping json which maps your custom confidentiality levels to existing data.all confidentiality <br/> For e.g. ```custom_confidentiality_mapping : { "Public" : "Unclassified", "Private" : "Official", "Confidential" : "Secret", "Very Highly Confidential" : "Secret"}```<br/> This will display confidentiality levels - Public, Private, Confidential & Very Highly Confidential - in the confidentiality drop down and maps it existing confidentiality levels in data.all - Unclassified, Official and Secret |


### Disable and customize core features
In some cases, customers need to disable features that belong to the core functionalities of data.all. One way to restrict 
a particular feature in the core is to add it to the core section of the `config.json` and enable/disable it. 

```json
    "core": {
        "features": {
            "env_aws_actions": true,
            "cdk_pivot_role_multiple_environments_same_account": false,
            "enable_quicksight_monitoring": false
        }
    }
```
This is the list of core features that can currently be customized. Take it as an example if you need to 
disable or modify the bahavior any other core feature.

| **Feature**           | **Module**     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |   
|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| env_aws_actions       | environments   | If set to True, users can get AWS Credentials and assume Environment Group IAM roles from data.all's UI                                                                                                                                             |
| cdk_pivot_role_multiple_environments_same_account       | environments   | If set to True, the CDK-created pivot role as part of the environment stack will be region specific (`dataallPivotRole-cdk-<region>`). This feature allows users to create multiple data.all environments in the same account but multiple regions. |
| enable_quicksight_monitoring       | environments   |  If set to **true**, RDS security groups and VPC NACL rules are modified to allow connection of the RDS metadata database with Quicksight in the infrastructure account (default: false)        |


## 8. Run CDK synth and check cdk.context.json <a name="context"></a>
Run `cdk synth` to create the template that will be later deployed to CloudFormation. 
With this command, CDK will create a **cdk.context.json** file with key-value pairs that are checked at 
synthesis time. Think of them as environment variables for the synthesis of CloudFormation stacks. 
`cdk synth` retrieves information from the AWS account that the AWS CLI has access to. For this reason
we will run `cdk synth` as many times as AWS accounts we are using, with the corresponding credentials:

- With tooling account AWS credentials:
```bash
cdk synth
```
- With deployment account N AWS credentials:
```bash
cdk synth
```
Here is an example of a generated cdk.context.json file. Data.all requires one subnet per 
Availability Zone. In case more than one subnet per availability zone is returned in the cdk.context.json file, remove 
the subnets that won't be used in the deployment. 
````json
{
  "vpc-provider:account=XXX:filter.vpc-id=vpc-XXX:region=eu-west-1:returnAsymmetricSubnets=true": {
    "vpcId": "vpc-1234567890EXAMPLE",
    "vpcCidrBlock": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/22",
    "availabilityZones": [],
    "subnetGroups": [
      {
        "name": "Private",
        "type": "Private",
        "subnets": [
          {
            "subnetId": "subnet-XXX",
            "cidr": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/23",
            "availabilityZone": "eu-west-1a",
            "routeTableId": "rtb-XXX"
          },
          {
            "subnetId": "subnet-XXX",
            "cidr": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/24",
            "availabilityZone": "eu-west-1b",
            "routeTableId": "rtb-XXX"
          },
          {
            "subnetId": "subnet-XXX",
            "cidr": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/24",
            "availabilityZone": "eu-west-1c",
            "routeTableId": "rtb-XXX"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
````
## 9. Add CDK context file <a name="context2"></a>
The generated cdk.context.json file **must** be added to your source code and pushed into the previously created CodeCommit
repository. Add the generated context file to the repo by running the commands below 
(remember, with the tooling account credentials).
```bash
git add cdk.json
git add cdk.context.json
git commit -m "CDK configuration"
git push
```
## 10. Run CDK deploy <a name="deploy"></a>
You are all set to start the deployment, with the AWS credentials for the tooling account, run the command below. 
Replace the `resource_prefix` and `git_branch` by their values in the cdk.json file. 

```bash
cdk deploy <resource_prefix>-<git_branch>-cicd-stack
```
In case you used the default values, this is how the command would look like:
```bash
cdk deploy dataall-main-cicd-stack
```
## 11. Configure Cloudwatch RUM (if enable_cw_rum=true) <a name="rum"></a>

If you enabled CloudWatch RUM in the **cdk.json** file: 

1. Open AWS Console
2. Go to CloudWatch service on the left panel under Application monitoring open RUM
3. Select your environment (data.all-envname-monitor) and click on edit button.
4. Update the domain with your Route53 domain name or your CloudFront distribution domain (omit https://), and check include subdomains.
5. Copy to clipboard the javascript code suggested on the console.
![Screenshot](../img/rum_clipboard.png#zoom#shadow)
6. Open data.all codebase on an IDE and open the file `data.all/frontend/public/index.html`
7. Paste the code on the clipboard like below:
![Screenshot](../img/rum_code_update.png#zoom#shadow)
8. Commit and push your changes.

## 12. Setting SES for Email Notifications <a name="ses"></a>

Please follow instructions from below only if you have enabled email notifications on share workflow by switching the email.active config ( from `config.json` file ) to `true` in the `share_notifications` feature under `datasets` module.

### Moving AWS SES out of Sandbox
If you have specified `custom_domain` in `cdk.json` and set `modules.datasets.features.share_notifications.email.active` to `active` in `config.json`, after the deployment you should see a SES identity which is formed in your AWS Account. 
You can check it by going to the AWS Console -> AWS SES -> Identities. At this time you have successfully deployed infrastructure to 
send email notifications via SES, but your AWS account is in the Sandbox mode. When in Sandbox mode, you will have to verify each 
recipient email id manually. In order to get your SES account out of Sandbox, please follow the instructions in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html">Moving out of Sandbox</a> .
Once your AWS SES account is out of sandbox you can send email to any recipient email id without any prior verification. 

### Monitoring for Email Bounces
When SES Stack is deployed during the pipeline stage, it will setup a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/using-configuration-sets.html">configuration set</a>
which will send any email bounces, delivery failures, rejects & complaints to an SNS topic. In this step, you can add subscriptions to this SNS topic to monitor email delivery problems
In order to do that go to AWS Console -> SNS -> Select the SNS topic which would look like `{resource_prefix}-{envname}-SNS-Email-Bounce-Topic` ( where resource_prefix and envname are specified in the cdk.json ) -> Create Subscription. You can attach multiple subscriptions to
this SNS topic and monitor and take actions in case of any delivery failure.

## 🎉 Congratulations - What I have just done? 🎉 
You've successfully deployed data.all CI/CD to your tooling account, namely, the resources that you see in the
diagram.

![archi](../img/architecture_tooling.drawio.png#zoom#shadow)

With this pipeline we can now deploy the infrastructure to the deployment account(s). Navigate to AWS CodePipeline
in the tooling account and check the status of your pipeline.

To learn more about how to get started using the data.all UI and get a holistic understanding of supported features please check out the <a class="nav-item"  href="{{ site.workshop_url }}" aria-haspopup="true">Getting Started Workshop</a> and the data.all UserGuide (available as [PDF](https://github.com/data-dot-all/dataall/blob/main/UserGuide.pdf) in the open-source repository or via the data.all UI).

## Best practices and recommendations <a name="best"></a>

### Deployment parameters
Some of the deployment parameters in the `cdk.json` strenghten the security posture of the deployment. We encourage users
to configure data.all with the following values.
- Set `enable_pivot_role_auto_create` to `true`: it allows data.all to scope down permissions to the pivot role. 
It also avoids manual management of pivot roles, which the subsequent reduction of manual errors.
- Set `cognito_user_session_timeout_inmins` to the minimum: which constraints the impact of malicious actors impersonating a cognito user.


### Least privilege permissions
Data.all strives to fulfill this principle for all roles and personas using the platform. There are some additional
guidelines that could serve customers to follow this principle when setting up AWS accounts to use data.all.

- Access to the deployment account(s) should be restricted to data.all maintainer teams. IAM roles with limited permissions will be provided to these teams only.
- Access to the tooling account should be restricted to developer teams. IAM roles with access only to the CICD 
necessary resources will be provided to these teams only.
- Access in the environment account(s). Data personas should use the provided IAM team roles to produce and consume data. Other IAM roles in the Environment 
AWS Account should have limited permissions. You might use imported-IAM roles to data.all or consumption roles to adjust to your particular requirements.
- Access in the environment account(s) for CDK execution role, should use the scoped-down CDK exec role policy that can 
be downloaded from the data.all UI when linking a new environment. This CloudFormation template can then be used in the CDK bootstrap command.



### Managing new releases and customizations

To get the latest features and fixes, customers are encouraged to **keep in sync** with the latest version of data.all.
At the same time, customers often develop their own features and customizations on top of data.all. We recommend 
customers to **contribute back** these features so that we can manage them and respond to issues. Moreover, contributing back
makes it easier to keep in sync with the latest data.all releases. Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file in 
data.all's GitHub repository for more information on how to contribute back to data.all.


## FAQs <a name="faqs"></a>

### How does the `prod_sizing` field in `cdk.json` affect the architecture ?

This field defines the size of the backend resource. It is recommended to set it to `true` when deploying into a production environment, and `false` otherwise.
By setting the value to `true`, data.all backend resources are more available and scale faster.
When setting the value to `false`, backend resources become smaller but you save up on cost.

These are the resources affected:

| Backend Service     | prod_sizing | Configuration

### I used the wrong accounts or made another mistake in the deployment. How do I un-deploy data.all?
In the above steps we are only deploying data.all tooling resources. Hence, if the CI/CD CodePipeline pipeline has not 
been entirely run, nothing has been deployed to the infrastructure account(s).

To clean-up the tooling account we have to simply delete the 2 AWS CloudFormation stacks deployed in the account:
- In your selected region: `<resource_prefix>-<git_branch>-cicd-stack`
- In us-east-1: `<resource_prefix>-<git_branch>-cicd-stack-support-us-east-1`

Some AWS resources have deletion particularities:
- Aurora Database for integration testing: deletion protection is enabled by default and will result in `DELETE_FAILED`
in AWS CloudFormation. Enable deletion in RDS before deleting `<resource_prefix>-<git_branch>-cicd-stack`. 
- KMS keys are marked as `pending deletion` and once the waiting period is over they are effectively deleted. This is
their default behavior explained in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html).
- The S3 buckets created by the deployment will not get deleted by AWS CloudFormation automatically, given these contain objects. Before running a new deployment, remove the S3 buckets matching the naming convention `<resource_prefix>-<git_branch>-cicd-stack-xxxxxxxxx` first to prevent a CloudFormation error reporting on already existing buckets.

### Troubleshooting - The CodePipeline Pipeline fails with CodeBuild Error Code "AccountLimitExceededException"
Sometimes, we run into the following error *"Error calling startBuild: Cannot have more than 1 builds in queue for the account"*.

### I would like to migrate to Amazon OpenSearch Serverless
If you have deployed data.all with Amazon OpenSearch and would like to migrate to Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, 
you would need to migrate the indexes to your new cluster. Although data.all currently does not provide an automated 
migration tool, it is possible to do so manually using the following approaches:
- [Migrate your indexes to Amazon OpenSearch Serverless with Logstash](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/migrate-your-indexes-to-amazon-opensearch-serverless-with-logstash/).
- [Migrating Amazon OpenSearch Service indexes using remote reindex](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/remote-reindex.html)

### Enforce TLS1.2

If custom domains (frontend and backend) are not specified then AWS CloudFront and APIGateway will automatically
generate them for you. By AWS's design those autogenerated domains are still accepting TLS1.1 which is considered unsafe and they cannot be
configured otherwise. By using custom domains >=TLS1.2 is enforced.
