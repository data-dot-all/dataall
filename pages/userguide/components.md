# **Main components**
This section introduces the main components of data.all which are divided in 3 groups. This is an overview, for more
details please refer to their specific sections.

- **Administrate**: used by team and data lake administrators to organise and manage teams and users inside data.all
- **Discover**: used by all users to contribute with data, search for data and share data.
- **Play**: once data is in data.all, all users can use these tools to work with data.


## **Administrate**

### Organizations
<a href="organizations.html">Organizations</a> are high level constructs where business units can collaborate across different AWS accounts
at once. An organization includes environments (see below). Organizations are abstractions, they **don't** contain AWS
resources, consequently there is no CloudFormation stack associated with them.

*Organizations usually correspond to whole organizations, organization divisions or a separated geographical region
within an organization.*

### Environments
An <a href="environments.html">environment</a> is a workplace where a team can bring, process, analyze data and build data driven applications.
This workspace is mapped to an AWS account in one region. It is possible to have more than one environment in the same
AWS Account, however we recommend to stick to one environment -  one account.

*An environment usually corresponds to a business unit or a department. Inside an environment we add teams and
assign them different levels of permissions.*

### Teams
A <a href="environments.html">team</a> corresponds to an IdP group that has been onboarded to data.all. A special case for the administration of
data.all is the **Tenant**, an IdP group with high level application (tenant) permissions. As with IdP groups, users can
belong to multiple teams.

*Teams corresponds to real teams.*

> **ðŸ’¡ but really, what are teams?**
>
> Data in data.all is isolated at team level, meaning that all members of a team can access all team's datasets.
> Thus, a team is any group of users that can access the team's datasets. We can have bigger teams with generic data
> and project-based teams owning data that requires more restrictive access to only members of the project.


## **Discover**
### Datasets
A <a href="datasets.html">dataset</a> is a representation of multiple AWS resources that helps users store data.
When data owners create a **S3 dataset** on data.all the following resources are created:

- Amazon S3 Bucket to store the data on AWS.
- AWS KMS key to encrypt the data on AWS.
- AWS IAM role that gives access to the data on Amazon S3.
- AWS Glue database that is the representation of the structured data on AWS.

*Inside the dataset we can store structured data as tables or unstructured data in folders.*

Alternatively, when data owners import a **Redshift dataset** on data.all a subset of the tables can be imported from a specific Redshift database schema.

### Catalog
data.all centralized <a href="catalog.html">Catalog</a> is an inventory of datasets, tables, folders and dashboards. It contains metadata for each
of the mentioned data assets and thanks to its search capabilities, users can filter based on type of data, type of
asset, tags, region and on glossary terms.

*We use the Catalog to search and discover data*

### Glossaries
A <a href="catalog.html">Glossary</a> is a list of terms, organized in a way to help users understand the context of their datasets.
For example, terms like "cost", "revenue", etc, can be used to group and search all financial datasets.

*Glossaries are used to add meaning to data assets metadata facilitating and enhancing Catalog searching*

### Shares
A <a href="shares.html">Share</a> is an access request to a data asset. Users search and discover data in the catalog and for those data assets
that belong to other teams, users can create a Share on behalf of a team (remember, data access: at team level!!). Then,
the owners of the asset can accept or reject the share.

*We use Shares to collaborate and share data with other teams.*

## **Play**
### Worksheets
Worksheets are AWS Athena sessions that allow us to query our datasets as if we were in the AWS Athena Query editor
console.

### Notebooks
Data practitioners can experiment machine learning algorithms
spinning up Jupyter notebook with access to all your datasets. data.all leverages
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi.html" target="_blank">
Amazon SageMaker instance</a> to access Jupyter notebooks.

### ML Studio
With ML Studio Notebooks we can add users to our SageMaker domain and open Amazon SageMaker Studio

### Dashboards
In the Dashboard window we can start Quicksight sessions, create visual analysis and dashboards.

### Omics
Provides the capability to view and instantiate HealthOmics Ready2Run workflows against data.all datasets and save omics data from workflow output.
